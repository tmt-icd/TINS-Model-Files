description = """
The Prime Focus Camera Assembly (PFCA) provides wide-field imaging for
commissioning, alignment, and engineering observations.  It controls a cooled
sCMOS sensor, a five-degree-of-freedom positioning stage, and a six-slot filter
wheel.  PFCA streams images to the VBDS and publishes quick-look telemetry so
TCS and AIV software can monitor image quality and instrument status in real-time.
