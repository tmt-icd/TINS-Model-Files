description = """
The Global Metrology System Assembly (GMSA) commands three laser trackers mounted
on the telescope elevation structure.  Using the Spatial Analyzer SDK, it executes
predefined Measurement Plans, returns 3-D coordinates of SMR targets on M1, M2,
M3, and instrument reference rails, and publishes alignment quality metrics.  GMSA
is part of the Test Instrument System (TINS) and supports commissioning, nightly
alignment, and engineering diagnostics.
