description   = """
The Test Instrument System (TINS) supplies on-telescope diagnostic instruments used
during integration, verification, nightly alignment, and engineering observations.

 • Prime Focus Camera Assembly (PFCA) - a wide-field imaging system with filter
   wheel and 5-DOF positioning stage, delivering high-resolution images and quick-look
   telemetry to the VBDS.

 • Global Metrology System Assembly (GMSA) - three elevation-structure laser trackers
   driven via Spatial Analyzer to measure SMR targets on M1, M2, M3, and instrument
   reference rails, returning 3-D coordinates and alignment quality metrics.

Together, these assemblies enable precise optical alignment, mirror phasing checks,
and rapid performance verification throughout commissioning and regular operations.
